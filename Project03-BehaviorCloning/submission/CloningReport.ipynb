    "In this project, the operations and the images on the [simulator](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/fbf77062-5703-404e-b60c-95b78b2f3f9e/modules/6df7ae49-c61c-4bb2-a23e-6527e69209ec/lessons/46a70500-493e-4057-a78e-b3075933709d/concepts/1c9f7e68-3d2c-4313-9c8d-5a9ed42583dc) by the human operator are recorded. A neural network is then build using Keras and trained with the recorded data to achieve fully autonomous driving on the given track. "
